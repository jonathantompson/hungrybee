2. Check order of scale and translation
3. Add heightmap for each level --> Make a nice hightmap and debug weird shading (maybe need to make a model instance)
4. Implement collision routine: bounding spheres are easiest and quickest (collision with heightmap shouldn't be too stressful
5. Implement player controls: using quaternions to give half distances
