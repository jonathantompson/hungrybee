1. Put together RK4 integrator for gameObjects --> Decide whether game controls should be force or impulse
2. Implement collision routine: bounding spheres are easiest and quickest (collision with heightmap shouldn't be too stressful
3. Implement player controls: using quaternions to give half distances and RK4 integrator
4. Load the fucking models in...  Having lots of difficulty
5. Improve sphere-sphere collision detection routine --> use a method that avoids the sqrt call AND gets around floating point accuracy for large velocities
