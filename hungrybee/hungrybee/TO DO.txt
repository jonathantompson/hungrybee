1. Get renderer correct -> Fix background and check depths make sense
2. Check order of scale and translation
3. Add heightmap for each level
4. Implement collision routine: bounding spheres are easiest and quickest (collision with heightmap shouldn't be too stressful
5. Implement player controls: using quaternions to give half distances
