- Implement player controls: using quaternions to give half distances and RK4 integrator
  a) Need to center object properly --> After rotation, circle no longer lies in XY plane --> Results in some unstable behaviour I think
- Implement enemy direction pointing --> Face where they're following (but use desired oritiontation to smooth out movements)
- Implement HUD display for frame-rate and player health
- Implement player Vs. enemy collision health or kill animation (set object to non-collidable, non-movable and increase scale)
- Load the models in...  Having lots of difficulty

STUFF I WOULD LIKE TO DO IF I HAVE TIME
- Fix interpolation for draw.  Interpolation works, but DRAW() is giving wierd gameTime inputs. (How does XNA handle it)
- Fix swept sphere collision code for AABB-sphere collisions --> Glancing collisions are failing to be detected. (where velocity is nearly perpendicular to collision normal)
- Fix swept collision bug where collision time returns 0.0f if the objects start close but not intersecting (0.0000001f distance)
- Actually implement a LCP solver so that I can do Baraff's "Fast Contact Force Computation for Nonpenetrating Rigid Bodies"
  a) Resting contact code is a hodge-podge of non-physical hacks.  Anti gravity force to allow resting vertically + small impulses to push resting objects apart.
  b) Either implement the paper as is OR
  c) Try and bring in Dave Eberly's Geometric tools LCP solver as C++ managed code.
- Reduce redundant computations in collision detecdtion.
  a) Only flag dirty AABB for objects that move.
  b) Cache matricies and transformed bounding objects for fine collision detection (nothing saved at all!)
  c) By-and-large the collision detection / responce routine is horribly unoptimized
- Coarse tune data structures are wasteful.  Some are O(n^2).  Reduce to only have (numCollidables choose 2).
- Improve sphere-sphere collision detection routine --> use a method that avoids the sqrt call AND gets around 
    floating point accuracy for large velocities
