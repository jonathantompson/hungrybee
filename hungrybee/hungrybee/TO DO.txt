1. Put together RK4 integrator for gameObjects --> Debug.  Constant acceleration, velocity is fine, but distance is all screwed up (should be ideal if constant)
2. Implement player controls: using quaternions to give half distances and RK4 integrator
3. Implement collision routine: bounding spheres are easiest and quickest (collision with heightmap shouldn't be too stressful
